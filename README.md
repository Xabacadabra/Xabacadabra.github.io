# Skinny Bones Jekyll Starter

Just a little something I'm using to jump start a site refresh. I like to think of it as a starter for building your own Jekyll site. I purposely keep the styling minimal and bare to make it easier to add your own flare and markup.

**Jekyll 3 Update:** A version of Skinny Bones compatible with Jekyll 3 can be found in the [`jekyll3` branch](https://github.com/mmistakes/skinny-bones-jekyll/tree/jekyll3). GitHub Pages is [locked at version 2.4](https://pages.github.com/versions/) so some keep that in mind if you're trying to use 3.0 features that aren't supported there yet.

I'm currently using a variation of it on my personal website [Made Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com) with some modifications. To learn more about how to use the theme and install it check out the [Skinny Bones demo](http://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/) (*work in progress*).
